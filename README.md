this project observes the MIRA variable IK_Tau 
in 12CO and 13CO, both lines detected,
but 13CO a lot weaker (about 10-15x)


In 12CO some additional (circumstellar) 
emission around the central source can be seen.

Note that "bad" beams vary a lot over the many days, those are recorded using pix_list= in the comments.txt file
